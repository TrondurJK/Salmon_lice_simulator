## General info
Managing salmon louse _Lepeophtheirus salmonis_ outbreaks is a crucial part of salmon aquaculture in sea cages. Treatment management strategies can be optimized with the aid of salmon-louse population dynamic models. The aim of this project is to create such a model, simulating salmon lice in the Faroe Islands, to describe the general development of salmon lice abundance in the Faroes, in order to better predict and mitigate the issues the lice bring.

	
## Technologies
The project is created with:
* Python version 3.7 or newer.
	
## Setup
To run this project, you need to install Python. Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The repository can be downloaded to your local environment, where running the file Test_run.py will simulate a simple test run where no external data is needed. Be aware that matplotlib 3.3.2 or newer is needed.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_

## Inspiration
Tróndur T. Johannesen, Torstein Balle and more. Project inspired by Revie et al. (2005), Stien et al., (2005), Adams et al., (2015) and more. Development parameters based on Hamre et al., (2019).

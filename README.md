# Salmon_lice_simulator
An cohort based salmon lice simulator which couples hydrodynamic lice dispersion with population dynamics of a per farm basis.

Test_run.py will simulate a simple test run where no external data is needed. Be aware that matplotlib 3.3.2 or newer is needed.
A description of the model structure is shown below.
